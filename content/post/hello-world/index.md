It's Sunday morning and the weather is looking good, so staying in bed is not an option. At 10am, we drove to la Faucille on top of Jura - a place with amazing hicking tracks that I just can't recommend enough. Once we got there, we checked the options in this map. It's like a menu with tracks for courses and the duration for price. Since me and Jimil had already hiked to la Turret we choose la Vattay - 1h15 away.

With no idea of what to find in this place we started walking up the mountain. Here are some pictures of our way up:

The track is surrounded with this vegetation - musgo, trees and at some point ice and snow, which we were not expecting in this time of the year - Parth was wearing sport shoes instead of hiking shoes so he's ski season started earlier. The floor was covered with lesmas, I guess they like this humid weather.

A cool thing we found on the way up was this cavity, covered with ice and snow shaped like their draining down the whole. There is no way for all this water to escape once it melts so I guess the hole should be quite deep, so we prefer not to get too close.

Appart from this cavity we found many others, including small grutes. For me there's always something mysteirious when I find such a place in the middle of the nature, who knows where it will lead, what it has inside.

On the way down we found sharp stone walls on both sides, down we went until we reached the road and had a snack.

We didn't feel like hicking back the same way, so we decided to take the road but we ended in a place calle Mijout and had to ask for rescue because we were to tired to go back uphill until the car.

This gentlemen came in hour rescue, Thanks Jin we owe you one
